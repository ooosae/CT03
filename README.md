## Chapter II
## General rules

1. All along the way, you'll be accompanied by a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: it's perfectly normal. Don't forget that the information in the repository and Google is always with you, as are the peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense and don't be afraid of mistakes.
2. Be mindful of the sources of information: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, reread it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a task condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like that, try to figure it out. If it doesn't work, put the question in the list of open questions, and you'll find the answer as you go along. Don't leave open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible to complete, remember that it's not true: you only see it this way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter different tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are suitable for the most meticulous and inquisitive students. These assignments are of higher difficulty and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system and those around you. After all, you're fooling yourself first and foremost.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you resort to someone else's help, make sure you always understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't do you any good.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch will be ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those designated in the assignments.

## Chapter III
## Preparing for the interview
### What does it mean to prepare for an interview?

What an interview there could be:

- telephone (usually a quick talk for a further invitation to an interview);
- skype/zoom interviews - online interviews;
- in the company's office - offline interview.

There are a few important steps to take before going for an interview:

1. Read about the company and the position you've been invited to.
2. Look up information and read articles about the hiring manager (if you know him), look through his/her articles to get a rough picture of the person.
3. Rehearse a story about yourself and your major accomplishments at home.
4. Get your clothes ready
5. Get a good night's sleep and show up to the interview in a good mood.

Let's consider two types of interviews:

### Online interview

This is now one of the most popular forms of interviewing.
 Here are some basic preparation rules:

- **Appearance counts** Certainly, you should dress neatly, just as you would for an offline interview. Of course, the online dress code is simpler. The main rule is to find a decent top: shirt, sweatshirt, dress. Please, don't wear a housecoat, tank top, stained T-shirts, etc. First, it doesn't give you confidence when interviewing, and second, it distracts the recruiter and triggers internal judgments.
- **Your background** If you have astrological forecasts and natal charts hanging behind you, the interviewer may be distracted by them, so it is better to make the background neutral and not colorful, so as not to distract from the conversation.
- **Technical equipment** Be sure to check before the interview that you have everything working and keep extra equipment on hand in case of force majeure. If you have difficulties with the connection or your computer freezes unexpectedly, switch quickly to your phone. Also check your headphones so that both you and the person you're talking to can hear everything.
- **Quiet place** Try to remove any extra noise in the background. Of course, sometimes it's impossible to predict whether your neighbor will once again be repairing something or not. Nevertheless, try to take care of everything in advance.
- **No time for a snack** Don't eat during the interview. Even if you eat an apple at an interview, it's still distracting.

### Offline interview

Office interviews are now less common, but in some companies they are held regularly.
 Here are some basic rules:

- **Appearance counts** You don't have to wear a classic suit, there are definitely no strict rules nowadays. It is important that you look clean and tidy.
- **Plan your route** Plan your route to the office in advance. Study a map and find where the office is so you won't be late.
- **Warn in time** Sure, there are force majeure events, but they rarely happen a minute before the interview. So, plan your time in advance and try to show up on time.
- **Silent mode** Turn off your phone so you don't get distracted during the interview.

Remember, you're not the only one being interviewed for a position, but you're choosing your dream company. So, pay attention to how the interview is conducted, what questions are asked, and what the office environment is like.

### Frequent questions from the company

The best way to successfully pass an interview is to prepare for it. Here is a list of frequently asked questions.

Experience:

1. HR asks detailed experience questions that are relevant to the job.
2. Tell us about your projects that didn't work out and what did you learn?
3. If you've changed jobs often (working 3-4 months at a time), you're bound to be asked, "Why did you change jobs so often?".
4. If you are employed at the time of the interview, you better expect the question "Why do you want to leave your company?".
5. If you're not employed at the time of the interview, HR may ask you "Why did you quit the company?".

About you as a person:

1. An interviewer may say: "Name your strongest competencies. Why did you name these particular competencies?".
2. If you change careers/fields, you're bound to be asked "Why move to a new field?" "What motivates you?".
3. What do you enjoy about your work?
4. What do you dislike most about the job?
5. What competencies would you like to improve?

About teamwork:

1. Please, give me an example of a conflicting work situation. How did you resolve it?
2. Did you manage people? How did you lead the team?
3. What qualities do you like and appreciate in people?
4. What qualities are important to you in a leader?
5. What kind of person would you not be able to work with?

About the company:

1. Why do you want to join our company?
2. What made you interested in the company/job?
3. What do you already know or have heard about the company?

This list is exemplary and you should always be ready for such questions.

### Questions for the company

Often at the end of a job interview HR asks: "What questions do you have for us?". If your answer is "I don't have any questions", it's not a good thing: HR may feel that the candidate is not highly motivated to work with them. So always have a couple questions ready that are important to you.

A couple of sample questions:

1. How is the KPI of an employee's performance measured?
2. What are my career opportunities?
3. Why is the vacancy open?
4. What are your goals for the next six months?
5. How is the process of adaptation of a newcomer to the team organized?
6. Could you tell me about your corporate culture?
7. What does a typical employee's day look like?

## Think ahead
### Career goals

Interviewers often ask job seekers about their career goals. Keep your real goals in mind. Look at your Project 01. If you are clear about what you are aiming for, the employer will appreciate it because he/she will understand your motivation. Understanding the career goal also reflects the candidate's responsibility.

So be sure to think ahead of time about how the dream job will help you move toward your career goal in 1-2 and 3-5 years.
 The better you think through your answer, the better chance you have of being considered for the position.

### Salary questions

Almost any candidate in a job interview is afraid to talk about salary. Consider the following phrases: _"I'm afraid to talk about salary because what if I ask for too much and get rejected?"_. It reflects low self-esteem.

"I'm ashamed to talk about money" - this is a common behavior pattern among Russian people who remembered Soviet life, because then it was inappropriate to talk openly about money, a person just worked and earned the salary that the company assigned.

_"I don't know how much money to ask for!"_ - it indicates ignorance of how to value one's labor, devaluing one's labor and/or lack of market knowledge.

_"I don't like asking for money at all, I feel like a beggar!"_ – it reflects insecurity.

Each of these fears has to be worked with so that it doesn't affect your income level.

**What is the solution to all these challenges?** Try to stay on top of the salary analytics market. You can always google what the average salary range for specialists is:

1. There are useful resources that publish salary analytics (Zarlatometer, Salary Survey, Labor etc.).
2. You can look at the reports from staffing agencies that perform salary analytics, such as Hays or Antal.

**Why do you need to know your salary range?** To negotiate salary both at the recruitment stage and when talking about a raise.

1. Just knowing the salary range is not enough. You can't go to your manager and say: "It says here that the average salary of a Mid-Level Software Test Engineer is 1500 USD." Most likely, he or she will say something like: "So what?". And if you don't have the right answer, you won't get what you want.
2. Prepare yourself for the question "Why should an employer raise your salary?" What matters here is that you are showing results and your hard work in the company is making a difference/money. Then prepare a little progress report. What did you do? What have you accomplished? How was \*something\*/how is it now? What has improved as a result of your work/what indicators have increased/decreased due to what/what resources? If you don't have answers to questions like that, you're back to being left with the paycheck you had.
3. Look for yourself at the job analytics you did in Project02.
4. Self-esteem and insecurity are very complex and deep issues. You can address psychological literature, or go and work through the issue with a psychologist or coach. Both of these professionals deal with these issues and help find a solution.

Ideal preparation consists of: studying market research + your own analytics + your results.

When can you talk about paychecks?

1. When you start a new job.
2. When you can talk about a promotion at your current job.

If you are asked about your desired salary at your first interview, you can say: "I would first discuss all my tasks/objectives, then I'll be able to assess the cost of my work." Discuss the real numbers based on the actual tasks with the hiring manager.

You can shift the responsibility for the question to HR himself/herself and ask: "Can you tell me what salary range you are currently offering candidates? I need to figure out if I'm going to consider the offer or not". The HR manager, of course, can give you an answer like: "Well, it depends on the candidate's experience". Then you can go back to the previous advice and say that you are willing to discuss it after you understand what the candidate's tasks and goals are.

Once you decide to designate a salary range, you need to research the market and look at salary studies. Usually, candidates leave their previous job for a new one with a minimum 10-15% increase in salary (Of course, you should look at the tasks and relevance of your experience).
 If you change the direction/field, the salary may be less. But it's important to know the range for a new field as well, even if you're going for a junior position.

**Negotiation strategies**

1. Don't start an online or offline interview with a question: "And how much are you paying? What's the paycheck?".
2. Talk first about objectives, goals, what KPIs need to be met.
3. Prepare an answer to the question: Why are you considering this range? (You need to give arguments about the results of your past work, what you did, what results you achieved).

**How to estimate the real cost of your work:**

1. Talk to HR, go for an interview;
2. Study market analysis;
3. Do your own market analysis.

**Let's summarize:**

1. Deal with your fears and work through them so it doesn't affect your income level.
2. Study salary analytics.
3. Talk about salary from the perspective of your results.

### Uncomfortable and inappropriate questions

Unfortunately, HR or your hiring manager may not always be tactful in their questions. Here are some typical questions that can be perplexing:

"Are you planning a pregnancy?"
 "Why don't you have a husband/wife?"
 "How much does your husband/wife earn?"
 "What does your wife/husband think about your career ambitions?"
 "What is your star sign?"
 There may also be questions about religious beliefs, political views etc.

What to do in such situations and how to respond to a question from an employer?

1. Ask the employer why these questions are important to him or her and how it relates to the position you are interviewing for.
2. If the employer insists on these questions, end the interview if you're uncomfortable.
3. With questions like that, you have to choose to either share the company's corporate culture and answer the question or realize that this company is not the right fit for you.
4. Sometimes these odd questions may be asked to see how a candidate behaves in a stressful situation. Stress interviews were popular at one time. However, these interviews are rare now, but you may encounter them.
5. Try to transform an answer to questions like this into an appropriate joke.

## Self-presentation
### You need to be able to present yourself and speak intelligently about yourself and show your value

Talking about yourself often seems difficult for the candidate. Nevertheless, this is usually the very first question from the hiring manager or HR. How to answer it? You need to have a structure and prepare for the answer.

**You don't have to memorize a story about yourself.** When you are nervous, you can get confused and lose focus, so it's better to keep the plan in your mind, in a notebook, or in your phone.

**A plan to tell a story about yourself:**

1. Who are you? - your profession, how many years you've been in the profession.
2. Where did you go to university, what's your educational background?
3. What have you been doing the last 5-7 years in your career? - give a brief summary of the objectives and results.
4. Where do you work now and what are you responsible for? - tell the interviewer more about your current responsibilities and results.
5. Your career goals and motivation.

[Example of a story about yourself](materials/Пример_рассказа_о_себе.pdf)

### What not to talk about in a job interview

During the interview process, it is strongly discouraged:

- To discuss your personal problems at the first interview.
- To ask the first questions about salary.
- To judge a past employer (even if you parted on bad terms).
- To ask inappropriate questions about employees.
- To raise issues of religion and politics.
